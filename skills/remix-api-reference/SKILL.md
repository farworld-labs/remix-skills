## OpenAPI-First Rule

Before generating or executing API calls, fetch:

- `https://api.remix.gg/docs/json`

Use OpenAPI as the contract source of truth for:
- methods (`GET`/`POST`/...)
- paths
- params/query/body schemas
- response shapes

Base headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
Content-Type: application/json
```

Base URL: `https://api.remix.gg`

OpenAPI UI: `https://api.remix.gg/docs`

## Response Envelope

Success:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "...": "..." } }
```

Error:

```json
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "SOME_CODE", "message": "...", "details": null } }
```

## Endpoint Families

Use OpenAPI for exact paths; these are the stable groups:
- Metadata: categories
- Games: list/detail/create/update
- Analytics: overview and shop analytics for owned games
- Versions: list/detail/code/thread/status/validate/code-update
- Assets: list game assets, upload assets via `POST /v1/games/{gameId}/assets`
- Images: generate images via `POST /v1/games/{gameId}/images/generate`
- Shop images: generate shop icon art via `POST /v1/games/{gameId}/images/generate-shop-icon`
- Sprites: generate sprites via `POST /v1/games/{gameId}/sprites/generate`
- Items: manage shop items via `GET/POST /v1/games/{gameId}/items`, `POST/DELETE /v1/games/{gameId}/items/{itemId}`
- Readiness: launch readiness checks

## Not Exposed in Agent REST

- No delete route.
- No create-version route.
- No submit route.

## Asset Upload

Asset uploads are available via `POST /v1/games/{gameId}/assets`. You can upload binary files (icons, sprites, audio) directly through the API.

Assets can also be managed through the Remix app/Studio upload flow.

Canonical flow:
1. create game
2. upload/update version code
3. upload assets as needed via `POST /v1/games/{gameId}/assets`
4. optionally inspect analytics via the overview/shop endpoints
4. validate and/or launch-readiness
5. check status
