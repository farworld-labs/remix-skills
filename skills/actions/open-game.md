# Open Game in Remix Studio

Open the current game in the Remix Studio for preview and editing.

## Steps

1. **Read game settings** from `.remix-settings.json` in the project root.
   Extract `gameId` and `versionId`. If either is missing, tell the user
   they need to create/upload a game first.

2. **Construct the Studio URL:**
   ```
   https://remix.gg/games/{gameId}/v/{versionId}
   ```

3. **Open in the user's default browser:**
   - macOS: `open <url>`
   - Linux: `xdg-open <url>`
