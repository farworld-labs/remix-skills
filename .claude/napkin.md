## User Preferences
- Keep git remote changes direct: update `origin` when user provides a new repo URL.

## Patterns That Work
- Verify current remotes with `git remote -v` before changing `origin`.

## Patterns That Don't Work
- None yet.

## Domain Notes
- Repo: `/Users/chuckstock/repos/skills`.

## Session Notes
- 2026-02-08: Updated `origin` from `farworld-labs/skills` to `farworld-labs/remix-skills` and pushed `master` with `-u`; this is the correct flow for repo migration requests.
